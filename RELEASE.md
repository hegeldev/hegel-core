RELEASE_TYPE: patch

This patch adds a new `OneOfConformance` test, for the `one_of` generator.

This patch also adds recommended integer bound constants (`INT32_MIN`, `INT32_MAX`, `INT64_MIN`, `INT64_MAX`, `BIGINT_MIN`, `BIGINT_MAX`) for use in conformance test setup. Languages with arbitrary-precision integers should use the `BIGINT` bounds to exercise CBOR bignum tag decoding, which is not triggered by the narrower ranges most implementations currently use.
